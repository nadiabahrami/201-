// Step 1
/* Create a function called logPlace that will take two arguments. The first argument should be called 'marker' and 
the second should be called 'thing'.  The reuslt of this function should be a console.log entry that is a string in
the format of '(marker) thing'.

ex: marker = '*',  thing = "potato" the output in the console should be '(*) potato'
*/







// Step 2
/* Create a method called addItem that will take an array and an item.  The result should be the array with the 
item added on to the end of it.  If that item is not a string you should instead return. "Item is not valid."

ex: [], "potato" result = ["potato"]
ex: ["potato"], "ice cream" = ["potato", "ice cream"]
ex: [], 2 = "Item is not valid"
*/





// Step 3
/* Create a function called bulkAdd that takes and array, an integer and a string.  The result should be the array with the
string added to the end the number of times of the integer.  You should not use operators to do this. 
ex: ["potato"], 3, "ice" = ["potato", "ice", "ice", "ice"]
*/






// Step 4
/* Create a function called viewList that takes in an array of groceries and lists them in the console in order.

ex: ["potato", "ice", "apple"] = 
"(1) potato"
"(2) ice"
"(3) apple"
*/





//Step 5
/* Create a method that called checkOff that takes an array and an item(string).  It should log the starting 
ordered list.  Then remove the item from the list. Then it should log "I have bought the item!" Then display
 the remaing list (ordered) and return the list.
